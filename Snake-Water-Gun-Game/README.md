The provided code implements a simple game similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors, but with "Snake", "Water", and "Gun" hand signs. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Imports:**

- `random`: Used to generate a random choice for the computer.

**Hand Sign Values:**

- `1`: Snake
- `-1`: Water
- `0`: Gun

**Game Logic:**

1. **Computer's Choice:** The computer randomly chooses one of the three hand signs (`-1`, `0`, or `1`) using `random.choice`.
2. **Your Choice:** The user inputs their choice ("s" for Snake, "w" for Water, or "g" for Gun) through `input`.
3. **Choice Conversion:** It converts the user's input ("s", "w", or "g") to the corresponding hand sign value (1, -1, or 0) using a dictionary `youDict`. It also has a reverse dictionary `reverseDict` to convert the values back to hand sign names ("Snake", "Water", "Gun").
4. **Outcome:**
    - **Draw:** If both choices are the same, it prints "It's a draw".
    - **Win/Lose conditions:** It checks all other combinations using nested `if-elif` statements:
        - You win if Snake beats Water (you == 1 and computer == -1) or Gun beats Snake (you == 0 and computer == 1) or Water beats Gun (you == -1 and computer == 0).
        - You lose otherwise.
    - **Error handling:** A final `else` statement prints "Something went wrong!" if none of the conditions match.
5. **Output:** It prints the user's choice, computer's choice, and the game outcome.

**Writing to File:**

The current code doesn't write anything to a file. However, you can add functionality to write the game results (user choice, computer choice, and outcome) to a file for record-keeping. Here's an example:

```python
with open("snake_water_gun_results.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write(f"You chose {reverseDict[you]}\n")
    f.write(f"Computer chose {reverseDict[computer]}\n")
    f.write(f"Outcome: {outcome}\n\n")  # outcome variable set based on win/lose/draw
```

This code opens a file named "snake_water_gun_results.txt" in append mode (`"a"`) and writes the details to the file.
